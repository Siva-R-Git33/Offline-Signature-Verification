# Offline Signature Verification 


## Overview
This project focuses on offline signature verification to detect forged signatures using
machine learning techniques. The system compares a test signature image with genuine
signature samples and classifies it as genuine or forged.

## Objective
To improve document security by identifying signature forgeries using image processing
and machine learning techniques.

## Approach
- Signature images are treated as shapes and patterns
- Preprocessing is applied to improve image quality
- CNN is used for feature extraction
- Classification is performed to identify genuine and forged signatures

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Image Processing
- Pattern Recognition

## Dataset
- Offline signature images
- Includes genuine and forged samples
- Supports different writing styles and shapes

## Key Features
- Language-independent signature verification
- Automated forgery detection
- Image-based pattern analysis

## Results
The model successfully classifies genuine and forged signatures with satisfactory accuracy.

## Security Relevance
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in biometric authentication
and document security systems.

## How to Run
1. Open MATLAB
2. Load the project files
3. Run the main script

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy using advanced deep learning models
- Real-time signature verification
- Larger and diverse datasets
